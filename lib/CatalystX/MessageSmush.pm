=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module was inspired while working with Mischa Spiegelmock on a Catalyst project.  He had put together a small plugin/mixin (astonishingly similar to this one :-)
that allowed you to add an arbitrary number of messages to C<$c->stash> via an arrayref which could be iterated through by L<Template::Toolkit>.
